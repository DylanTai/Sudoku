# Sudoku
A project done during the C Piscine in 42 Silicon Valley that solves an inputted, legal, and singular solution Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking recursive method.

Differences from the PDF:
---
-Deleted auteur file
-Made a Makefile to create a binary file that mimics what the output is on the last page
-Put the ".c" files in a folder called "srcs" and the ".h" files in a folder called "includes" for organizational purposes
-Removed the directory "ex00" and put its contents in the main directory
